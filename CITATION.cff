abstract: >
  Project-Based Learning (PjBL) is widely used to foster technical and collaborative
  skills in higher education. However, teamwork in fully online environments often
  suffers from dysfunctional dynamics. Impulsive comments, non-constructive criticism,
  biased judgments, and rejection of feedback can generate destructive interactions
  and negatively affect project outcomes. This paper proposes Feed-Safe, a Large
  Language Model (LLM)-based approach for detecting and analyzing negative feedback
  in PjBL settings. The proposed model integrates motivational, communicative, and
  psychological safety factors to identify dysfunctional feedback patterns and
  support constructive regulation during collaborative work. Experiments conducted
  on a dedicated dataset show that the proposed approach reduces false and negatively
  relevant feedback, thereby improving communication quality, team cohesion, and
  overall learning performance. The results demonstrate the potential of language
  models to regulate feedback processes and mitigate dysfunctional team behaviors
  in online project-based learning environments.
