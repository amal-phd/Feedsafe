# PjBL-feedback
# PJBL Feedback Analyzer

This repository contains the implementation of a **Project-Based Learning (PjBL) feedback analysis system** designed to analyze interaction messages exchanged within student project teams.

The system automatically detects:
- **Feedback category** (e.g., task-related, coordination, evaluation)
- **Feedback type** (positive, negative, neutral)
- **Feedback intent** (suggestion, critique, encouragement, clarification, etc.)

The objective is to support research on **collaborative learning, feedback dynamics, and learner regulation** by providing a reproducible analysis framework.
